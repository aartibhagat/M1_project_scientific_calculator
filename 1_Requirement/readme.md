REQUIREMENT:-

## INTRODUCTION

## SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR

A Scientific Calculator is a calculator designed to help you calculate science, engineering, and mathematics problems.
In this project we are going to implement some calculator operations using C Language.
It has way more buttons than your standard calculator that just lets you do your four basic arithmetic operations of 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and scientific operations like modulus, power and factorial

# FEATURES:-

1.Scientific calculators include modulus, power, factorial and memory.
2.These functions are vital when you're working with scientific notation or any formula with any component. 
3.Basic calculators can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# RESEARCH:-

The project will be a simple Scientific Calculator implementation in C. You will use various 
calculations to calculate different mathematical operations. The output of the project will be a 
console application without any graphics. You should implement at least following mathematical 
operations.
Operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
 It is easy to apply the values in the system to find the required result rather than remembering and applying it in formula.
Thus by studying all these facts, the necessary functions has been implemented to get the required results in a better way.

# Cost And Functions:-
Depending upon the project how well it is built and all the requirements will meet the cost and it can be varied according to the market.

Addition : The addition Add(+) function takes two operands as input and the function results in a+b.

Subtraction : The subtraction Sub(-) function takes two operands as input and the function results in a-b.

Multiplication : The multiplication Mul(x) function takes two operands as input and the function results in a*b.

Division : The division Div(/) function takes two operands as input and the function results in a/b.

Power : The power(^) function takes two operands as input and the function results in X^Y value.

Modulus : The modulus(|x|) function takes two operands as input and the function results in |x| value.

Factorial: The factorial(!) function takes one operands as input and the function results in X! value.

# Defining Our System:-

# 4W's and 1'H :-

- # Who

The project is used by everyone in day to day life. All the students and employess who requires the calculations will use the program to find their answer.
The main objective of this project is the user should be satisfied with friendly interface and fast calculation therefore any student can use it.

- # Where

It has to be used easily by the users.
In all the Domains it can be used and the project is portable and user-friendly. 
It should overcome all the drawbacks of the Old existing system and most important of all meet the user requirements.

- # When

The project can be used when the calculations are required and get the results for basic and Math related problems and the result will be obtained fastly.

- # Why

I am Developing this basic scientific calculator to perform basic operation in best easy manner and improve my coding skills.
We can except the results that user can perform mathematical operations like arthimetic and Scientific operations.
All the basics functionalities are included in the project. User can use the program efficiently and get the required results.

- # How

I am using C programming language for Developing this simple basic scientific calculator.In all the Domains it can be used and the project is portable and user-friendly.
It should overcome all the drawbacks of the Old existing system and most important of all meet the user requirements.
